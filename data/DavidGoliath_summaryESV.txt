Now the Philistines gathered their armies for battle. And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered, and encamped in the Valley of Elah, and drew up in line of battle against the Philistines. But if I prevail against him and kill him, then you shall be our servants and serve us.” And the Philistine said, “I defy the ranks of Israel this day. The three oldest sons of Jesse had followed Saul to the battle. The three eldest followed Saul, but David went back and forth from Saul to feed his father's sheep at Bethlehem. For forty days the Philistine came forward and took his stand, morning and evening. And Israel and the Philistines drew up for battle, army against army. Surely he has come up to defy Israel. And Eliab's anger was kindled against David, and he said, “Why have you come down? I know your presumption and the evil of your heart, for you have come down to see the battle.” And David said, “What have I done now? He put a helmet of bronze on his head and clothed him with a coat of mail, and David strapped his sword over his armor. So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and struck the Philistine and killed him. When the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they fled. And David took the head of the Philistine and brought it to Jerusalem, but he put his armor in his tent.
